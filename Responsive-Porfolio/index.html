                        Hi, my name is Kevin Tran. I am a part-time student at the University of Oregon Full-Stack Flex Program.
                        My hobbies as of now are programming, playing my guitar, and hiking. So far programming is
                        going well. It's keeping me up at night, but I don't have any regrets.
                        <br><br>
                        I am doing this program because I want to change my career. I want to do creative and
                        meaningful work while building relationships with interesting people. I believe 
                        this industry will open doors to work in that space. If things don't work out, at least
                        I know how to code. Also, coding is fun! 
                    </p>

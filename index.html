                    Hi, my name is Kevin Tran. I am a part-time student at the University of Oregon Full-Stack Flex Program.
                    My hobbies as of now are programming, playing my guitar, and hiking. So far programming is
                    going well. It's keeping me up at night, but I don't have any regrets.
                    <br><br>
                    I am doing this program because I want to change my career. I want to do creative and
                    meaningful work while building relationships with interesting people. I believe 
                    this industry will open doors to work in that space. If things don't work out, at least
                    I know how to code. Also, coding is fun! 
                </p>
